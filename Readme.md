This is a normal data.C’est un mon premier *post* de 2023 et premier **post** en Français…je voudrais poster en français temps de temps…c’est ma résolution pour 2023!Et voila, c’est mon premier voyage professional aussi…as I start my 2023 journey with first stop in Italy, I would like to thank everyone in the Energy community for there support last year and I look forward to our exchanges in coming months.When I look into the energy landscape today and various entities involved in their efforts to achieve net zero 2050, lot has been promised and various initiatives have been taken. As my Master (Guru) in Hindi, Pujya Rakeshji Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur said, “we all have some uniqueness in all of us” and if we all can come together, looking outside the boundary of our role in our organization and connect to bring a change, we can discover lot of opportunities to achieve the climate ambition much quicker and in efficient manner. On that note, I would like to initiate a movement #Intogether and focus on connecting the energy community together. You can be from power producer or OEM or a digital expert, we call can make a huge contribution, if we decide to go #Intogether to achieve our climate ambition. So that’s one of my goal of 2023, to bring all experts together, from various industries and geography to speak on one common ambition!! #IntogetherFollow me or connect with me to grow this community #Intogether
